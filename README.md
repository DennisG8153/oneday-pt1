What is a Manual Merge?

So you want to merge a pull request on GitHub, but the magical green 'Merge' button's not there, and instead you're told 'This pull request cannot be automatically merged' A manual merge is a forced merge.
# How to Merge
1. Open the terminal.
2. Change the current working directory to your local project.
3. Check out the branch you wish to merge to. Usually, you will merge into master .
4. If there are conflicts, resolve them.
5. Commit the merge.
6. Review the changes and ensure they are satisfactory.
7. Push the merge to your GitHub repository.
